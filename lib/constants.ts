// dB SPL ESTIMATION
// ============================================================================
// Web Audio gives us linear amplitude from the mic. True dB SPL requires the
// mic's sensitivity, which the browser doesn't expose. We derive the default
// offset from the typical MEMS mic spec: 94 dB SPL ≈ −26 dBFS, so full-scale
// (0 dBFS) ≈ 120 dB SPL.
//
// Real devices vary ±5–10 dB from this; calibration (Phase 4) is required for
// any quantitative clinical claim. The per-device calibrated offset, once
// measured, replaces this default — it is stored in localStorage keyed by
// deviceId (see lib/storage.ts).

// dB SPL TARGET ZONES (clinician-driven, adaptive)
// ============================================================================
// The meter and strip chart render in calibrated dB SPL — NOT in RMS fractions.
// The old RMS thresholds put the "too loud" line at ~70 dB and capped the chart
// at ~72 dB, so any healthy 75–85 dB voice was wrongly flagged "too loud" (the
// #1 clinician complaint). These dB values fix that.
//
// The green band is personalized:
//   - FLOOR = the patient's baseline, set by the clinician during /setup and
//     ratcheted up as they improve (see lib/storage baseline + useSession).
//     TARGET_FLOOR_DEFAULT_DB is only the fallback when /setup hasn't run.
//   - CEILING is an interim absolute value. An amplitude ceiling can't tell
//     healthy-loud from hyperfunction — the F0 fast-follow will refine this.
//     Until then keep it permissive so healthy 80–85 dB voices stay in green.

// Auto-ratchet: the green floor nudges UP as the patient improves, mirroring
// what the clinician does by hand ("once you pull them up this low end shifts
// up"). Conservative + always reinforcing — it only ever rises, requires
// several consecutive comfortable reps, and is capped so the green band never
// collapses. A clinician can reset it in /setup.
